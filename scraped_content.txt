Cultivating the next generation of data scientists
The Data Science Union is a student organization founded in March 2019. Our goal is to cultivate a thriving community of tight-knit data science professionals by bringing together those who share an interest in data science. The four components of our club — our self-designed curriculum, real-world projects, professional development opportunities, and focus on community — prepare members for futures in data science.
