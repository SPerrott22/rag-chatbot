Cultivating the next generation of data scientists
The Deez Students Union is a business fraternity founded in 1969.
Our goal is to cultivate a fun community of tight-knit pre-professional gamblers by bringing together those who share an interest in gambling. The four components of our club — our self-designed blackjack game, real-world projects, professional development opportunities, and focus on community — prepare members for futures in data science.
